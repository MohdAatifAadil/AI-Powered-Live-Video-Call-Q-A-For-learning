# AI-Powered-Live-Video-Call-Q-A-For-learning
AI Learning Platform for Instruction and Student Interaction

Study AI is an independent, AI-Powered educational platform desined to change the way learning and teaching happen.
Teachers upload course meterials (Video, PDFs, slides, Images, Audio, pptx, articles, links.), which the system uses to autonomonusly learn and understand the content.
The AI Then assists in live Video Call by reasoning through complex question, providing real-time, contextually relevant answers based on the uploaded materials.

The platform uses advanced NPL models for understanding, processing, and generating responses, with continuous self-learning from student interactions to improve over time.
Importantly, Study AI operates entirely without the uses of external APIs-everything from training the AI to generating responses is managed internally within the platform.
This ensures full control over the system and eliminates dependency on third-party services, enabling scalability and customization.
The result is a fully autonomous, personized learning assistant that can be applied across subjects and learning enviroments, providing instant feedback and enabling efficient, interactive learning at scale.
